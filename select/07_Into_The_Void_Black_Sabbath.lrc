[01:39.56] Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
[01:42.65] Up into the night sky they blast
[01:45.85] Through the universe the engines whine
[01:49.10] Could it be the end of man and time?
[01:52.36] Back on earth the flame of life burns low
[01:55.30] Everywhere is misery and woe
[01:58.59] Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
[02:01.86] Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah
[02:20.86] 
[02:26.88] Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
[02:30.07] Up into the black sky so vast
[02:33.12] Burning metal through the atmosphere
[02:36.42] Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
[02:39.57] With the hateful battles raging on
[02:42.66] Rockets flying to the glowing sun
[02:45.84] Through the empires of eternal void
[02:48.96] Freedom from the final suicide
[03:03.96] 
[03:11.61] Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
[03:15.16] Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
[03:18.88] Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
[03:22.86] Find another world where freedom waits, yeah
[03:44.86] 
[03:58.45] Past the stars in fields of ancient void
[04:01.33] Through the shields of darkness where they find
[04:04.74] Love upon a land a world unknown
[04:07.80] Where the sons of freedom make their home
[04:11.08] Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
[04:14.24] Leave them to their future in the grave
[04:17.59] Make a home where love is there to stay
[04:21.13] Peace and happiness in every day
