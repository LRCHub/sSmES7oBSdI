Under the moonlit sky
We see the forces die
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling
Under the moonlit sky
Oh, how you fall and die
So long now, so long now

Under the moonlit sky
The stars fall and die
How the sea rages, oh love bruises
It's like the world you've known
Before it's lost and gone
Unlike a world you've seen
Before it's lost to me

Under the moonlit sky
Just hold my hand and try
Hold me soft tonight
Beneath the quiet lights
Under the moonlit sky
I'll hold your hand of lies
But in my arm's colder
Oh, lost soldier

Under the moonlit sky
We see the forces die
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling
Under the moonlit sky
Oh, how you fall and die
So long now, so long now
Under the moonlit sky
We see the forces die
Oh, ashes falling, oh, while it's falling
Under the moonlit sky
Oh, how you fall and die
So long now, so long now

So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now
So long now, so long now
